# Docspell Android Client

This is a very basic android app that can be used to upload files from
your android device to [docspell](https://docspell.org).

It works as follows:

- create a list of docspell urls and store them inside the app
- the app hooks into the "share with" android menu
- Use whatever app, for example a document scanner app and share the
  result with the docspell android app. It will upload it to the
  configured url.
