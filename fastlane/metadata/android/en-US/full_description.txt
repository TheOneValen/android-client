This is a client for uploading files to Docspell, a free,
effective document organizer. It requires a hosted docspell server
to connect to. The app hooks into the *Share With* menu to allow
uploading files from other apps directly to your server.

For example, the free [[com.todobom.opennotescanner]] app scans
documents using the camera and with this app you can upload them
easily to your document organizer.
